     - `seed-data.sql` for initial data seeding.

   pnpm dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

- **Development**: `pnpm dev`
- **Build**: `pnpm build`
- **Start Production**: `pnpm start`
- **Lint**: `pnpm lint`

### Testing Forms Before Schema Migration

Before pushing schema changes to Supabase, thoroughly test all forms:

1. **Run automated tests**:

   ```bash
   # Test all forms integration
   pnpm test:forms

   # Test contact form specifically
   pnpm test:contact

   # Run comprehensive dev environment check
   pnpm test:forms-dev
   ```

2. **Validate database schema**:

   ```bash
   pnpm validate-schema
   ```

3. **Manual testing checklist**:

   - Use the checklist in `scripts/manual-test-checklist.md`
   - Test all forms in browser at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Verify email delivery, database saves, and Stripe integration

4. **Generate and apply migrations**:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate  # Generate migration files
   pnpm db:migrate   # Apply to database
   ```

The site uses Next.js App Router for routing, with pages in `/app/` and components in `/components/`.

## Contact Form Email Setup

The contact form uses Gmail SMTP with an App Password for reliable email delivery.

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=steve@ceceriforma.com
SMTP_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx   # 16-char app password (remove spaces)
CONTACT_TO=steve@ceceriforma.com
CONTACT_FROM=steve@ceceriforma.com   # keep same domain to avoid spoof flags
```

### Gmail App Password Setup

1. Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled for `steve@ceceriforma.com`
2. Visit https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords while logged into Steve's account
3. Create an "App Password" (select Other â†’ name it "WebsiteContact")
4. Copy the 16-character password (this is your SMTP password)
5. Update the `SMTP_PASS` environment variable

### DNS Configuration (Google Workspace)

Ensure these DNS records are properly configured for deliverability:

- **MX Records**: 5 Google MX records with priorities (1,5,5,10,10)
- **SPF**: `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`
- **DKIM**: Generated through Google Admin Console
- **DMARC**: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@ceceriforma.com`

### Maintenance

- **Rotate App Passwords**: Google Account > Security > App Passwords > Delete old > Create new
- **Update Vercel**: Update `SMTP_PASS` environment variable and redeploy
- **Monitor**: All messages land in `steve@ceceriforma.com` inbox with subject prefix `[Contact]`
